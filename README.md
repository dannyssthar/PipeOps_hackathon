# PipeOps_hackathon

I've fixed the little bugs in the HTML code...
I decided to keep things simple since it's a hackathon. I was only using Html, CSS and JavaScripts files (server.js and app.js).
I decided to up my game by intergrating bootstrap but some minutes later, I realized that I wouldn't be do some things easily without ussing react js. Since it's a web project, I don't want only the backend part to be awesome but also the user interface and React js is the best choice for this.

So I currently create a react app. Next I will do the little ui changes before I will intergrate python into this language. 

Also I realized that there were little bugs in the backend version of this project recently so I will fix that real quick then I will move on.
