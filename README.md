Good Day viewer here is my documentation so far: 

DOCUMENTATION
1. Setting up the environment:

2. Created a virtual environment and installed necessary libraries.
3. Documented this process in README.md

4. Machine Learning Model:

a. Generated synthetic data to simulate appointment scheduling (model.py).
b. Trained a LogisticRegression model and saved it as appointment_scheduler.pkl.
c. Created a script train_model.py to train a RandomForestClassifier with mock data.
d. Backend Service:

I. Developed a Flask application (ai_service.py).
ii. Configured logging to track application events.
iii. Loaded the pre-trained model and handled exceptions during loading.

5. Defined routes to render HTML templates and handle form submissions.
6. Implemented an endpoint /optimize-schedule to process scheduling requests and predict optimal time slots using the model.
Frontend Integration:

7. Created HTML templates (index.html, schedule.html, about.html, live-chat.html) and linked them using Flask's url_for function.
8. Added CSS files for styling.
9. Wrote a JavaScript file (app.js) to handle form submissions and user interactions.
10. Integrated Flask and JavaScript to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

11. Testing:

12. Tested the application locally to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
13. Ensured the model prediction endpoint is called correctly and the response is handled properly on the frontend.
